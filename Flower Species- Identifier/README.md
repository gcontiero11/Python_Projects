# KNN Algorithm
- Using a database named iris.data.csv with the infos: sepal_length , sepal_width , petal_length , petal_width and specie name.
- When placing a new flower with unknown species in iris.data_2.csv, using the KNN Algorithm, the program calculates the "k" flower species closest to the unkown flower and deduces a specie for it.
